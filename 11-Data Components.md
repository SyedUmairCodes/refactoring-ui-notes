When designing components that will display data to the user it's a common mistake to treat all of the data fields as labels, which, should be avoided so that all data fields don't look the same and don't have any visual hierarchy to them.

In designs like a dashboard, labels are not required and should be treated as a supporting content. The data displayed in the graphs on the dashboard is what matters most and should be easily readable. 

If you're building designs like a technical specifications table then you need to emphasize on the labels as you're displaying data in a table format. 

> Combining labels with a value is a great way to display information. 

A pricing component that also shows the amount of stock for that item make the title and stock count of the same color.
