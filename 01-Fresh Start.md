Starting a new design completely from the ground up can be a challenging task, if you don't have the complete requirements or haven't decided on the features that your product will have.

Figure out the main components of your product first and then get to desiging. If you spend time designing a cool navigation component but later found that the product doesn't need a navigation component then your effor will be wasted.

You can always use that component in another design but you designed something that wasn't needed and this can be quite a blunder when your working with tight deadlines.

> Focusing on the main features and components will help you save time and also get your work done faster.
