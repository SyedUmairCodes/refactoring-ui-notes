If you have a pre-defined color scheme or a design system that you will use for the aesthetics of your design then start using it from the beginning so that you can incorporate it into your design easily.

If not, don't stress over it. Start your design with black and white colors and then add colors and accents at the end so that you don't waste time experimenting with colors while your design isn't even finished.

Creating designs in monotone or gray scale will allow you to experiment with spacing, contrast and size of the design and you'll end up with a cleaner design that you can add color to whenever you want.
