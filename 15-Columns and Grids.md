Using a column layout is also a great way to use extra screen real-estate but don't force your UIs to be crammed in small spaces if you want to use the extra space then use it. A grid system will keep your UIs simple and clean but not all elements should be designed with a grid system. 

The problem with treating grid systems like a religion is that there are a lot of situations where it makes much more sense for an element to have a fixed width instead of a relative width.

> Not every part of an interface should be sized relative to one another.

Let go of the idea that everything needs to scale proportionately and give yourself the freedom to fine-tune things independently.
