# Refactoring UI | A book about UI design from the creators of TailwindCSS

This repository contains all of my notes that I took from the book Refactoring UI by Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger.

I use Obsidian as my main note taking tool of choice so these notes will look way better and more organized if opened in it but since the files are common markdown files you can open them up in any app that supports markdown files including GitHub itself.
